# financial_priority_manager

This application was used to demonstrate my proficeny with php's Laravel framework. 



This project is meant to be used by a family to determin whos reponsible for what. 
Breaking down the the expenses based on needs/ wants / credit charges / misalanious the person is able to enter the category and add expenses/income for that category for that person. 
On the budget page It shows expense- income and the top 4 most expnsive items to be addressed.


Budgeting is the only way to break though to the upper social classes as earning allows for a creep of life style that consums the difference.
